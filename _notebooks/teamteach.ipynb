    "- Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation\n",
    "- Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases\n",

    "- When you watch or search up certain things, data can be deduced on what is the \"norm\" for the person\n",

    "- Suppose a software was created to assist loan officers, and certain trends of successful loans were taken\n",
    "- If people are rejected of those who don't fit in their trends of either age, gender, race, etc.\n",
    "- This software is biased in the way that it only chooses candidates who will have higher chances in successful loans\n",

    "Example 2: Candy Crush vs Call of Duty\n",
    "- Call of Duty is geared towards the teenage boy demographic, 18-24, with more grunge type of music\n",
    "- Candy Crush is more visually appearing to younger audience as it includes pictures of candies and playful music \n",
    "- This is biased as the games include aspects and characteristics that will seem appealing to a specific audience "
